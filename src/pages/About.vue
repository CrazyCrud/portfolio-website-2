        As a fun oriented person, I've taught myself front-end development, as well as attended courses in order to hone my design skills. With 3 years of professional experience in web design and development, I consider myself skilled enough to proudly present a selection of my projects. Additional skills of mine are video editing, photography editing and color correction.

        My daily front-end workflow consists of using Stylus for stylesheet preprocessing, Pug for templating, and Gulp for automating the many tasks necessary to deliver quality websites.

        I'm extremely passionate about technology and entertainment; my interests range from mobile hardware and Android software, to games. I'm a great fan of the Counter-Strike franchise, and have been playing it passionately for over a decade.

        I believe that every digital artist needs to have fitting music following their every pixel and byte. My music of choice is located on the deeper end of the spectrum.
